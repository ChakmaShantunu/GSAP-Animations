| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| HTML5      | Page structure |
| CSS3       | Styling and layout |

## ✨ Features

- Timeline-based GSAP animation
- Sequential animation for multiple elements
- Clean and simple structure

## 🚀 How It Works

- Animations are controlled using **GSAP Timeline**
- `box1` moves to the right using `.to()`
- `box2` animates from the right using `.from()`
- Timeline ensures animations run **one after another**

## 📦 GSAP Setup

GSAP is included via **CDN** in the `index.html` file. No build tools or frameworks are used.
